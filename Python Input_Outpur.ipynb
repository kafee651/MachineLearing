Recording sessions for Thriller took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California with a production budget of \\$750,000 (US \\$1,842,155 in 2016 dollars[1]), assisted by producer Quincy Jones. Of the album's nine tracks, four were written by Jackson. Seven singles were released from the album, all of which reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
